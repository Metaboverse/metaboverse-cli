# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Adapted from [Contributor Covenant v1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Please see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Jordan Berg (jordan<dot>berg<at>biochem<dot>utah<dot>edu). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.

## Standards
A contribution is defined as a major or minor module addition or a major bug fix of the software. For minor issues and bugs, please submit a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/issues) and a Metaboverse team member will review and implement the change if appropriate. If you wish to contribute to [Metaboverse](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse) in another way, please fork the repository and make the changes you see as useful. Submit a pull request and a member of the Metaboverse team will perform a review of your code. All additions should include the appropriate documentation and test cases. A change will not be merged until documentation and tests are provided, and the proposed changes pass all tests. Where possible, please conform to current formatting of Metaboverse code for consistency's sake.
